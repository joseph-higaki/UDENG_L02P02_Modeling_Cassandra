# Overview / Purpose
Creates a Cassandra keyspace and loads song streaming data to answer 3 questions.
Each question has a different table.

# How to run
Ideally you should connect to your cassandra instance. 
I had a CentosOS image that I used at my EAE Masters but for reasons that I still haven't sorted out, I couldn't connect my host pc to my guest OS to reach the Cassandra DB engine.
THerefore this python notebook was run only at the Udacity workspace that offered a cassandra instance already up & running
